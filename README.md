# battle_llama

I am a student from NTHU(Taiwan), and love programming so much.I am also a lover of art, so you can see most of the images in the project file are drawn by myself.
This is important for me because it is my first project that I get into the realm of Computer Sience.

Introducing this project simply, it actually is the final project of the course, Introducing Of Programming, and the goal is to program a simple pvp game using C language with ALLEGRO tools.
Uhmm...then I chose a weird theme...
This is a story about two llamas, and they want to be the PQ(party queen), so they have no choice to have a fierce fight...

Hope everybody loves it.

Note: you can download the ALLEGRO files by yourself. The llamas images are from the website Piskel. It is not my work.
